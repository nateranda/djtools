Because maintaining a library is hard enough

### Manifesto
Engine DJ is, in my opinion, my favorite library management software: it's completely free, it's simple but powerful, and it looks good. However, it's only useful if you have Denon gear, because the program only exports to Engine USB.

But it doesn't have to be that way! `djtools` is meant to extend the feature set of Engine DJ with tools that make finding music, managing your collection, and exporting playlists even easier.
